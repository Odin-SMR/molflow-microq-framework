Minimal requirements:
    server:
        list jobs
        fetch job
        lock job
        get data
        deliver data
    client:
        fetch job
        deliver data

Next steps:
    server:
        separate fetch and claim
        job status get and update
        unlock job
        start using entrypoint instead of start.py
    client:
        separate fetch and claim

After that:
    Human readable list and job status
    handle timeouts
